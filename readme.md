#Gangzheng Tong's Blog

This is my personal website and blog, and also the final project for CS1520.
For demo visit www.gtong.me

The front end is built with AngularJS and Bootstrap. All the contents are injected dynamically from either the apache mysql database or the MongoDB.
The back end consists two part. For the homepage and its admin, I use php and mysql. For the blog, I adapt from https://github.com/kdelemme/blogjs and use NodeJS and MongoDB.
